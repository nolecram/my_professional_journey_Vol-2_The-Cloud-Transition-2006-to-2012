Documentation of IBM Internal Professional Development Courses completed 2006-2013. These courses covered the technology landscape and learning priorities of that era—system management, infrastructure, early cloud computing, and business skills. As technology evolved over the past 15 years, many of these topics (Tivoli, SmartCloud, virtualization-centric thinking) have been superseded by container orchestration, serverless computing, and open-source platforms. This list serves as a snapshot of professional development during that period.
