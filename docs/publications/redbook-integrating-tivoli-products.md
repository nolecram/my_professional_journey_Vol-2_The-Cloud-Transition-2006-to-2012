## IBM Redbooks Reference

![IBM Redbooks Banner](../../assets/images/logos/ibm-redbooks-banner.jpg)

*IBM Redbooks provide in-depth technical information and practical solutions for IT professionals.*

---

This IBM Redbooks publication documents Tivoli system management products and integration approaches from 2009-2010. The technology landscape has fundamentally transformed over the past 15 years. Tivoli and proprietary systems management solutions have been largely superseded by open-source monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack), cloud-native observability platforms, and Kubernetes-based infrastructure. 

**This redbook is preserved as historical technical documentation reflecting enterprise IT practices of that era, not as current operational guidance.**

## Integrating Tivoli Products

This IBM Redbooks publication documented how Tivoli system management products could be integrated for IT operations. The redbook covered integration approaches, security considerations, data exchange, and practical deployment scenarios.

### Integration Topics

- Security integration and authentication
- Navigation and user interface integration
- Data sharing across applications
- Task integration and workflow automation
- Operational scenarios and use cases

### Netcool Component Contribution

Marco Celon contributed to the documentation and integration guidance for **Netcool**, a core component of the Tivoli portfolio specializing in network and service management. Netcool was a significant part of IBM's enterprise systems management suite during that period, handling event management, correlation, and operational alerting across complex IT environments. The Netcool integration patterns documented in this redbook reflected sophisticated event processing and multi-layer network management architectures that were enterprise standards in the 2000s.
