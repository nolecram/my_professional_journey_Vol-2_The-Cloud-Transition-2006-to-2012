# Comprehensive Timeline of IBM Professional Journey

This timeline chronicles a remarkable six-year journey with IBM across three continents—a journey defined not merely by certifications and courses, but by the people who made each achievement possible. From the collaborative offices of IBM Italia, through the dynamic environment of IBM Middle East, to the innovative teams in IBM Australia, each location brought mentors who guided, colleagues who inspired, and customers who challenged and trusted.

Every entry in this timeline represents more than a professional milestone; it reflects the support systems, learning opportunities, and cultural exchanges that IBM fostered. The progression from foundation technologies to cloud computing, from regional focus to international scope, was made possible by an organization that invested in people and believed in continuous growth.

This documentation serves as grateful recognition of that investment and the global community of IBMers who contributed to this professional development journey.
