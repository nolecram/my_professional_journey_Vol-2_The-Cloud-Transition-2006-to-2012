# My IBM Professional Journey

## Introduction

This repository chronicles a transformative professional journey with IBM spanning 2006 to 2012—a period of extraordinary growth, learning, and international experience across three continents. IBM provided exceptional opportunities for continuous skill development and professional advancement, enabling a career path that extended from Italy to Dubai and ultimately to Australia.

The journey represents more than certifications and technical achievements; it embodies the invaluable mentorship, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing that define IBM's culture. Working alongside talented colleagues across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific regions, and engaging with diverse clients worldwide, shaped both technical expertise and professional perspective in profound ways. IBM's commitment to education extended beyond internal training, supporting academic pursuits through partnerships with institutions like Università degli Studi Roma Tre for advanced studies in IT Governance.

This documentation serves as a grateful acknowledgment of IBM's investment in professional development—35 internal courses, 23 professional certifications, a Master's degree through university collaboration, technical publications, and countless learning experiences. Each certification earned, each course completed, and each project delivered represents the support of managers who encouraged growth, colleagues who shared knowledge, and customers who trusted expertise.

To the mentors, teammates, and clients encountered throughout this international journey: your guidance, patience, and collaboration made this progression possible. This repository is a tribute to those experiences and the people who made them meaningful.

*With fondness and gratitude for the IBM chapter—its people, its opportunities, and its enduring impact on professional development.*
